Human Activity Recognition
=======================================================

The aim of this study is to identify the how well an exercise is carried out by a person given a set of observations of itself by exploiting supervised machine learning techniques. Human activity recognition using sensory data has become an active field of research in the domain of mobile computing.
The *how (well)* investigation has only received little attention so far, even though it potentially provides useful information for a large variety of applications,such as sports training.
